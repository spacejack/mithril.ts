# Experimental Mithril Typescript repo

## Don't use this!

I am just messing around with Typescript to better understand some of the denser parts of the codebase.

Please visit [the official repo](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js) instead.

## Install

    npm install

Use VSCode, and install the tslint extension to peruse the code.
